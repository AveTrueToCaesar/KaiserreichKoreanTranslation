 BOS_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of "heavy" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

The deployment of these conversions helped cement the concept of armoured transports in Austrian doctrine."

 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the revolution and civil war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat. Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

The Chilean Mauser 1895 has earned a reputation for reliability under even the harshest conditions, one which it maintains decades after its adoption.

Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter. A few months after its initial production, the rifles began to trickle into Patagonia."

In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."

It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."

They hail from the Gewehr 98 rifle design which was completed in 1898, and was developed into the Gewehr 98b design in 1924, and then shortened into the Gewehr 98k design. G. 98k rifles are considered bulky and heavy compared to contemporary rifles, and the bolt-action might mean a slower firing rate.

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Alongside the German Mauser, the Lee-Enfield is perhaps one of the most recognizable rifles in service with any military. Although the No.1 Mk.III* saw use in the Legation Cities well before the Weltkrieg in the hands of the old British garrison, the revolution in 1926 and the retreat of the China Station to Australasia in the same year saw the rifle continue service with police forces across the Legation Cities, as well as with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nAs most of these rifles were Weltkrieg-era surplus, and many have long been without proper maintenance or replaceable parts, attrition has taken its toll. Now that there may be too few rifles to furnish an expanded police force, some have come to regard the Lee-Enfield as necessarily obsolete."

The compartment of the armored vehicle has skylights, allowing the crews to reach out of the compartment, in order to suppress a crowd with strong light or high-pressure water guns.

The rifle's total length is shortened to 1000mm, its weight reduced to 3.2kg, and equipped with a shorter sight (100 to 1000m rather than 2000m) to be more suitable for jungle warfare in general which fights at a closer distance."

Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

Therefore, in March 1932, he ordered the engineer Jiang Shouting to go to Tianjin to negotiate with the representatives from the American Federal Motor Truck Company. The Americans eventually agreed to transfer the 1.5 ton truck technology to Shanxi, and Jiang Shouting used this as a basis to create the reliable and durable Type Shanxi by the end of the same year."

The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."
