 POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence. However, a romantic nationalist, Estigarribia has only encouraged extreme movements which seek to ultimately depose him. Whether he survives politically is an open-ended question that time alone shall answer."
 POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_RETURNED_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence.\nWith the return of democracy, Estigarribia's political career at first seemed to have come to an end. Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is nowhere near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

 PAR_pensions_desc:0 "War veterans, families of the lost and many other personnel receive rightful compensation for defending our nation in the war for the Chaco. However, doing the right thing is often costly and our budget suffers from all the privileges and good payment for military personnel."
 PAR_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky-high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available."
 PAR_bm_desc:0 "More than a fiscal crisis, Paraguay suffers from a harsh case of lack of imports, as the few goods imported to South America rarely reach the nation."
 PAR_bm_selfsuf1_desc:0 "After a series of decisive measures, we have finally re-gained out capacity to acquiring goods and started making said goods in our nation. We are taking the first steps towards true independence, as painful as they are."
 PAR_bm_selfsuf2_desc:0 "We have reached industrial output levels high enough for the government to declare our programs a success. An empty boast when it comes to most metrics, but one that increases national morale and thus increased spending in the short turn, as the people regained faith in the economy and the state recovered much of its losses."
 PAR_slash_desc:0 "Harsh budget cuts were the way chosen to deal with our budgetary issues. It won't go well with the military whose pensions are at risk..."
 PAR_deus_vult_desc:0 "Our land was always a bastion of faith, defending the land from the greedy hands of our neighbours. The church's close relation with our regime ensures that the people know who's in the right at all times."
 PAR_cav_desc:0 "Trucks can be faster, but you just can't trust the infrastructure deep in the South of the world. Sometimes, a position needs to be reinforced, and hastily so, and our horsemen also can use their mobility offensively with their new funding and training."
 PAR_elite_army_desc:0 "Truly with no equal, Paraguay is now truly an Army with a State, as its military forces have achieved such hegemony over all matters, and such mastery of their local warfare, its doubtful for its legacy to fade away."
 PAR_no_pasaran_desc:0 "Those who fought for our nation, even against unimaginable odds; Those who fought against Bolivian aggression and foreign plots, they know what its stake and will never give up as long the fight can continue!"
 PAR_everymanasoldier_desc:0 "Every man is ready to do his duty, and to die for the nation. Paraguay will never again be at the mercy of foreigners, who plot to keep our mighty people under their thumb!"
 PAR_training_desc:0 "Strict regimens and expanded funding ensure that we can send every able-bodied man to the field with proper training."
 PAR_planning_bonus_desc:0 "Our expert and veteran generals have much experience in planning and preparing offensives, but now they have the proper tools and are accustomed to planning war against actual foes, not just Bolivians."
 PAR_exportseffort_desc:0 "Our economy should not be isolated, and we should not hesitate to help our neighbours to recover. The profits we get by fulfilling their import demands are nothing but byproducts of being a good neighbour, wishing prosperity for the continent."
 PAR_freedom_desc:0 "The rampant nationalist zeal in our country came from more than a lack of faith in common politicians, but the utter failure of our nation to properly protect individuals and free enterprise, leading to war and unrest. Part of these fall on our inability to correct our constitution and move away from the shadowy delusions of leftist vultures."
 PAR_shock_et_awe_desc:0 "The Paraguayan general staff knows that it's unfeasible to stay on the defensive forever, and have more experience in modern war than most armies. The current shift towards offensive policies comes from years of debates and developments, but currently, it is fair to assess it's the predominant school of thought."
 PAR_doctrine_review_desc:0 "The best way to learn is by studying your own mistakes. Via constant reviewing and advancing, we will always ensure that our forces are neither outdated nor predictable."
 PAR_your_new_empire_desc:0 "José Felix Estigarribia's control over Paraguay is nigh absolute."
 PAR_PUS_IDEA_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by the ideas of US senator Huey Long, but with a unique militaristic spin, the Estigarribia government has changed its government to its core, and the power of the president is almost unchecked."
 PAR_fowardthinking_desc:0 "If our nation is to move forward in any way, we must ensure that those with the minds and qualification to take it there are properly funded and promoted"
 PAR_operational_autonomy_desc:0 "We may be small, but our reach to strike back is vast, for our planes are designed, and pilots trained, to keep the fight abroad."
 PAR_workersofthehomefront_desc:0 "Every person must do their part for the state. Everyone will work to aid us the way they can, and the brave Women of Paraguay will help supply our brave armies."

We Paraguayans have a proud tradition of standing up against imperialists, and as such, we believe we can add up our experience to their cause. We shall contact them immediately and see if they are willing to stand side by side with us"

 PAR_new_challenge_desc:0 "The Berlin Stock Market has crashed, and its effects are to be felt all around the globe. Its seismic waves have reached Paraguay, and now we have to deal with the enormous damage caused by this economic earthquake. The economy has suffered greatly, so nothing short of radical reforms will help."
 PAR_self_sufficency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
 PAR_self_sufficency_desc:0 "Paraguay's economy is in shambles, but its potential isn't. We should mobilise our budget to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."
 PAR_build_buildsake:0 "Building Industry"
 PAR_build_buildsake_desc:0 "While South America, in general, has an undeveloped industrial base, Paraguay's industry is even weaker. We need to construct new industrial complexes and for industrial purposes suited railways and roads to develop our industrial base."
 PAR_incentivize:0 "Civil Industry Incentives"
 PAR_incentivize_desc:0 "The state is mighty and powerful, but it can't do everything by itself either. We need to promote private enterprises and investments so that our industry can grow faster. Surely, if we give investors advantages, they will invest in our economy."
 PAR_agrieffort:0 "Agricultural Effort"
 PAR_agrieffort_desc:0 "A strong industrial base is vital for a modern economy, but we shouldn't ignore all those who won't build toasters, tanks and trucks. We need to set up agricultural subsidies and agricultural institutions which help our rural farming population."
 PAR_protectionism:0 "Protectionism"
 PAR_protectionism_desc:0 "Our economy doesn't only suffer from underdevelopment, it also suffers from cheap foreign competition. How are we supposed to sell our goods if foreign goods are cheaper? We need to protect our economy from the evil world!"
 PAR_factorio:0 "Import Substitution Program"
 PAR_factorio_desc:0 "A self-sufficient economy can't rely on imports, that's self-explanatory. We should find ways to avoid importing goods, we need to substitute everything that isn't made in Paraguay."
 PAR_factory:0 "Industrialist Advances"
 PAR_factory_desc:0 "Thanks to both the state and the people, our economy is quickly developing. Factories now stand there where nothing had stood before, and 'Made in Paraguay' is now omnipresent in our shops. Our industry is advancing quickly, and so should our technology."
 PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency:0 "Industrial Self Sufficiency"
 PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency_desc:0 "Our self-sufficiency plan works, that's for sure! Paraguay's economy now relies much less on imports and our manufacturing section is growing daily. 'Made in Paraguay' really does work."
 PAR_slash_debt:0 "Slash The Budget"
 PAR_slash_debt_desc:0 "Our state spends too much money, way too much money. We need to make cuts everywhere and anywhere if we wish to avoid bankruptcy. Most Paraguayans, from bureaucrats to veterans, won't be too happy with this, but we don't want to end up like the French in 1789, now do we?"
 PAR_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
 PAR_national_liberalism_desc:0 "The state can't play god, that is a sad reality. Instead of handing over the economy to the bureaucrats, we need to liberalise it in favour of private enterprise and economic freedom."
 PAR_export_focus_economy:0 "Export Focused Economy"
 PAR_export_focus_economy_desc:0 "The Paraguayan market is quite small, but the German market isn't. In order to maximise the strength and the profits of the Paraguayan economy, we need to augment the exportation of Paraguayan goods to the whole world."
 PAR_increase_yields:0 "Increase Mining Yields"
 PAR_increase_yields_desc:0 "The mining sector is relatively small, but even then the Chaco still has quite important resource deposits. We need to increase the productivity of the mining sector so that we can export more primary resources."
 PAR_cut_veterans_pensions:0 "Cut Veteran's Pensions"
 PAR_cut_veterans_pensions_desc:0 "The pensions paid to the veterans of Paraguay are simply too high for the state to support. We need to cut their pensions, even if this will severely anger all those affected."
 PAR_cut_military_incentives:0 "Cut Military Incentives"
 PAR_cut_military_incentives_desc:0 "Our military is quite enormous in comparison to the state. Our military spending is far too high, and it has not stopped rising. We need to cut military incentives before our state collapses under the burden of the military budget."
 PAR_intensified_propaganda:0 "Intensified Propaganda"
 PAR_intensified_propaganda_desc:0 "In these times of troubles, it is much easier for illegal groups and foreign rivals to destabilise Paraguay. We can't let anyone slander the name of our great nation, and we can't let anyone believe the lies of the enemy."
 PAR_the_outwards_solution:0 "Outwards Solution"
 PAR_the_outwards_solution_desc:0 "Now that our country stands weakened by the crisis, foreigners are glaring at Paraguay, waiting for any display of weakness in our borders to strike. We will focus our propaganda on the foreign threat until we are back on our feet, just in case one of them decides to strike first"
 PAR_estigarribato:0 "The Estigarribato"
 PAR_estigarribato_desc:0 "Our nation has suffered under political crises for far too long. It is time for our great leader to finally step in and protect the people of Paraguay from internal and external threats. Long live president Estigarribia!"
 PAR_national_heroics:0 "National Heroics"
 PAR_national_heroics_desc:0 "Our nation is a nation of heroes, a nation filled with the greatest people of history. We should never forget the people who fought for our freedom, protected our institutions, and advanced Paraguay to the beautiful nation that it is today."
 PAR_constitutinal_review:0 "Constitutional Review"
 PAR_constitutinal_review_desc:0 "Our constitution hinders the progress of Paraguay. We should do some changes here and there to protect the people of Paraguay from every threat! We are totally not just removing all the parts which are supposed to stop a dictatorship from forming."
 PAR_army_first_policy:0 "Army First Policy"
 PAR_army_first_policy_desc:0 "The army of Paraguay has always served the people, has always protected them and has always fought with loyalty and strength. Our army should get priority in the new, better Paraguay."
 PAR_guardians_of_the_nation:0 "Guardians of the Nation"
 PAR_guardians_of_the_nation_desc:0 "Pieces of papers don't protect a nation, its military does! Our army loyally serves Paraguay to guard and protect it from any threat, internal or external."
 PAR_PUS:0 "Paraguayan Union State"
 PAR_PUS_desc:0 "Our nation isn't a 'military dictatorship' like some politicians call it, it's a union of the people, the military, the state, every part of Paraguay! The Paraguayan state has never been this united."
 PAR_paraguay_first:0 "Paraguay First"
 PAR_paraguay_first_desc:0 "Our nation is the best, the greatest nation in the world! Our nation has priority in front of all the nations which aren't Paraguay. Our nation shall always be first place!"
 PAR_peace_and_justice:0 "Paz y Justicia"
 PAR_peace_and_justice_desc:0 "Paraguay has never been this stable, this well-protected, this united. Our new, better regime has introduced Paraguay to a never-ending period of peace and stability."
 PAR_defensores_del_chaco:0 "Defensores Del Chaco"
 PAR_defensores_del_chaco_desc:0 "Our beautiful nation has significantly grown in the last years at the cost of Bolivia. Our glorious soldiers have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but now it's time to consolidate our gains. The Chaco will forever remain Paraguayan!"
 PAR_doctrine:0 "Doctrine Review"
 PAR_doctrine_desc:0 "A major army reformation is required to defend our vast country. One of the most important things a modern army needs is a definite, efficient military doctrine. We need to overhaul ours to ensure that our army will win every battle."
 PAR_garra:0 "Garra Guarani"
 PAR_garra_desc:0 "Our soldiers have proven their strength and will on the battlefields of the Chaco! Our army is made for capturing land, not for letting the enemy capture our land. We need an offensive-minded doctrine!"
 PAR_offensive_mentality:0 "Offensive Mentality"
 PAR_offensive_mentality_desc:0 "Our glorious soldiers shouldn't waste their time and lives in some dirty trenches or bunkers infested with rats. We need to always have the initiative and always be on the offensive to win the future wars."
 PAR_pupupupush:0 "Continous Offensives"
 PAR_pupupupush_desc:0 "We cannot let the enemy reorganise and consolidate their forces after one of our successful offensives. We must attack them until we arrive in their capitals so that they will never have time to rest."
 PAR_william:0 "Mobile Force"
 PAR_william_desc:0 "Our army is focused on offensives and mobility, but simple infantry is rather unsuited for the latter. We need to create special mobile forces that shall be the fastest units on the battlefield."
 PAR_unstoppable:0 "Unrelenting Force"
 PAR_unstoppable_desc:0 "We shall not let our enemy rest! However, that means we won't be able to rest either. Our army shall attack with an unrelenting force so that the enemy will crumble!"
 PAR_casdoctrine:0 "Close Air Support Tactics"
 PAR_casdoctrine_desc:0 "It is rather difficult for any army, even the glorious Paraguayan army, to continuously fight battles after battles. We need to support our men on the ground with specialised aircraft."
 PAR_firepower:0 "Superior Firepower"
 PAR_firepower_desc:0 "Our nation doesn't have as many fighting-able men as Argentina or Brazil, so we need to compensate our low manpower with high firepower. Let's adopt a doctrine focusing on superior firepower and combat strength."
 PAR_atileery_battalions:0 "Artillery Battalions"
 PAR_atileery_battalions_desc:0 "The artillery piece is vital to increase the firepower of our army. We need to create special artillery battalions that will blow up the enemy wherever they might be."
 PAR_harry_spotter:0 "Spotters & Scouts"
 PAR_harry_spotter_desc:0 "There is one major issue with long-range artillery pieces: If we don't know where exactly the enemy is, we will just blow up a few squirrels. We need spotters and scouts that can accurately report the position of the enemy."
 PAR_concentrated_fire:0 "Concentrated Fire"
 PAR_concentrated_fire_desc:0 "A single artillery piece can kill a few soldiers with a perfect hit, but fifty artillery pieces can destroy a whole battalion with some decent hits. We need to concentrate our firepower for maximum effectiveness."
 PAR_doctrine_advances:0 "Doctrine Advances"
 PAR_doctrine_advances_desc:0 "Reinventing our doctrine is a long, costly process. We need to further advance our military doctrine so that our army will effectively fight on any battlefield."
 PAR_shock_awe:0 "Shock & Awe"
 PAR_shock_awe_desc:0 "Speed is the key to all modern war. It must be the main focus of our army if we are to defend our national borders."
 PAR_military_science:0 "Military Science"
 PAR_military_science_desc:0 "The process of reinventing our military doctrine was long and exhausting as we were missing enough theorists and military experts. We should invest more in military science to avoid this situation from happening again."
 PAR_caballeros_del_chaco:0 "Caballeros del Chaco"
 PAR_caballeros_del_chaco_desc:0 "Many Paraguayans have shown their excellent strength, will and resilience. We should honour these war heroes, as they are some of the finest people in the world!"
 PAR_motorization:0 "Motorisation Experiments"
 PAR_motorization_desc:0 "New combat weapons have made their debut during the Weltkrieg, be it the tank, the armoured car or motorised transport vehicles. We should invest in these new weapons as they will serve Paraguay well."
 PAR_logistcial_expertise:0 "Logistical Expertise"
 PAR_logistcial_expertise_desc:0 "One of the largest Bolivian shortcomings during the Chaco War was their supply system, as their communication and supply lines were inadequate. We should learn from their mistakes so we don't repeat them."
 PAR_new_army:0 "The New Army"
 PAR_new_army_desc:0 "Our glorious army won against Bolivia, but many doubt that we will win against Argentina or Brazil, who both own lands that are rightfully ours. We need to modernise and professionalise our army."
 PAR_guns:0 "Improved Equipment"
 PAR_guns_desc:0 "Our equipment is rather outdated, which gives us a disadvantage on the battlefield. We need to modernise and improve them to keep up with the armies of our rivals."
 PAR_guns2:0 "Boots on the Ground, Rifles on Hand"
 PAR_guns2_desc:0 "A problem facing our army is how many of our troops have outdated equipment or no equipment at all. We must move forward to newer tech options, and try to increase production."
 PAR_capacity:0 "Production Capacity"
 PAR_capacity_desc:0 "It is the sad truth that our military-industrial complex is smaller than that of Argentina or Brazil, but that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. We need to invest more in our production capacities."
 PAR_supply_capabilities:0 "Army Railways"
 PAR_supply_capabilities_desc:0 "A large issue that the Bolivian army faced in the Chaco War was the lack of proper infrastructure suited for military usage. We should not make the same mistake: We need to construct railways suited for military transportation."
 PAR_milfac:0 "Intensify Military Production"
 PAR_milfac_desc:0 "Our new railways have a large transportation capacity, but if our production capacity is low, we will not be able to use these railways. We need to increase the production of military equipment."
 PAR_every_woman_a_worker:0 "Every Woman a Worker"
 PAR_every_woman_a_worker_desc:0 "Our male adult population is quite small in comparison to that of our neighbours, and our army is taking up more and more of them. To fill the factories, we need to get women into the workforce."
 PAR_army_state_cooperation:0 "Army-State Cooperation"
 PAR_army_state_cooperation_desc:0 "Prussia has often been referred to as an army with a state. If any nation is the equivalent of Prussia, it is beautiful Paraguay. We should increase the cooperation between the army and the state."
 PAR_extreme_training:0 "Superior Training"
 PAR_extreme_training_desc:0 "Unlike the veterans of the Chaco War, the new recruits have little actual combat experience. We need to improve our training to keep a relatively high standard of experience in our army."
 PAR_we_werent_expecting_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
 PAR_we_werent_expecting_special_forces_desc:0 "The terrain of our nation isn't the same as the flat fields of Flanders. Made up of jungles, forests and hills with poor infrastructure, the terrain forces us to have units specialised in fighting in it."
 PAR_every_man_a_soldier:0 "Every Man a Soldier"
 PAR_every_man_a_soldier_desc:0 "Our population is roughly one million. In comparison, Argentina is the home of almost fourteen million. We need as many men as possible to fill our army if we wish to reclaim our rightful lands."
 PAR_militarism_extra:0 "Militarism"
 PAR_militarism_extra_desc:0 "In order to sustain our army, we need to increase the militarism of our population. Frequent parades, school books glorifying the military... We should employ every available method!"
 PAR_no_pasran:0 "No Pasaran!"
 PAR_no_pasran_desc:0 "Every man in Paraguay knows how to handle a rifle, and is willing to employ his knowledge if the enemy dares to advance in our sacred land. The enemy shall pay in blood for every meter of Paraguayan land he conquers."
 PAR_paraguayan_bias:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 PAR_paraguayan_bias_desc:0 "The enemy will be able to kill a soldier, render an artillery piece useless and destroy a truck, but he will not be able to destroy a mighty Paraguayan tank."
 PAR_extreme_army:0 "An Army With No Equal"
 PAR_extreme_army_desc:0 "Nowhere in the world, not even in 19th century Prussia, has an army been so well integrated into the state that it forms a union with the other national institutions. Nothing is as mighty as our armed forces."
 PAR_more_milfacts:0 "Further Production Capabilities"
 PAR_more_milfacts_desc:0 "Every soldier needs a rifle, a uniform and various other weapons and equipment. We need to further increase our military production capabilities to adequately arm our army."
 PAR_fortress_asuncion:0 "Fortress Asuncion"
 PAR_fortress_asuncion_desc:0 "The most beautiful city of the world is not Berlin, not Paris, not Madrid, but Asunción! We shall turn it into an unconquerable fortress so that the Paraguayan flag will always remain on top of the city hall."
 PAR_general_staff_power:0 "General Staff Review"
 PAR_general_staff_power_desc:0 "Our army has greatly expanded, but our general staff has been lacking behind in personnel. We need to review our general staff to increase its command capacity and effectiveness."
 PAR_specialforcetraining:0 "Extend Special Forces Training"
 PAR_specialforcetraining_desc:0 "Specialised units always require more training than their ordinary counterparts. We need to increase the effectiveness of the training so that more soldiers can effectively fight as members of a specialised unit."
 PAR_defensores_del_cielo:0 "Defenders of the Sky"
 PAR_defensores_del_cielo_desc:0 "Our beautiful blue sky is the home of many rare birds, but sadly our enemy doesn't seem to respect its quietness. We need to form a professional air force to defend the Paraguayan sky!"
 PAR_bomber:0 "Bomber Aircraft"
 PAR_bomber_desc:0 "If we gain air superiority, the enemy industrial areas will lie virtually undefended against an aerial attack. We need large aircraft with a significant payload to exploit this weakness to its full effect."
 PAR_cas:0 "Low Altitude Craft"
 PAR_cas_desc:0 "Industry and infrastructure aren't the only bombing targets there are, enemy units are also great targets. In order to effectively weaken enemy forces, we need more agile low flying bomber aircraft."
 PAR_stratbomber:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 PAR_stratbomber_desc:0 "A single bomb can destroy a piece of rail with a lucky hit, but one thousand bombs are guaranteed to destroy the entire railway hub. We shall rain havoc on our enemies from the sky!"
 PAR_airstaff:0 "Air Force Staff"
 PAR_airstaff_desc:0 "Our air force is quite young, and despite the usage of aircraft during the Chaco War, its staff is still very inexperienced. We need to expand and improve our air force staff."
 PAR_air_variants:0 "Airplane Experiments"
 PAR_air_variants_desc:0 "So far, our aircraft are mostly outdated imports. We need to experiment more with modern designs to improve our aircraft industry and our air force in general."
 PAR_fighter:0 "Fighter Aircraft"
 PAR_fighter_desc:0 "If we wish to use bombers and close air support aircraft effectively, we need to first achieve air superiority. We need specialised fighter aircraft to intercept and destroy enemy planes."
 PAR_long_range_fighters:0 "Long Range Fighters"
 PAR_long_range_fighters_desc:0 "Our fighters will be able to secure the air around our borders, but the most important bombing targets remain largely outside the range of ordinary fighters. We need larger fighters that are capable of longer flights!"
 PAR_long_range_capability:0 "Long Range Capabilities"
 PAR_long_range_capability_desc:0 "Most of the industrial centres of our future enemies lie far away from Paraguay, be it Buenos Aires, La Paz or Rio de Janeiro. Our air force needs to be equipped with long-range aircraft."
 PAR_foreign_advisors:0 "Foreign Advisers"

 PAR_aerial_supremacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
 PAR_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "The sky, just like the ground, will be controlled by Paraguay! No enemy aircraft shall ever reach Asunción! Now we just need to find a way to control the sea as well..."
 PAR_colorado_resurgence:0 "Colorado Resurgence"
 PAR_colorado_resurgence_desc:0 "The last Colorado president Paraguay has had was in 1912 with Pedro Pablo Peña who was deposed very quickly. This has left our country with a nearly unchallenged Liberal rule for decades. However, broken promises from the liberals and an ailing economy are leaving many Paraguayans disillusioned. We shall reach out to the common Paraguayan and offer them the solutions the Liberals didn't give them."
 PAR_true_values:0 "True Values"
 PAR_true_values_desc:0 "The Colorados has always been a conservative party. During the liberal governments, the Paraguayan populace was forced through several progressive reforms which many didn't agree with. Now that we're in power, we shall take steps to protect our nation's traditional and familiar values to secure our society for a better, more stable tomorrow."
 PAR_loyal_and_faithful:0 "Loyal & Faithful"
 PAR_loyal_and_faithful_desc:0 "The Paraguayan people have proven their loyalty and faithfulness during these last few decades, especially with the Chaco War. Such virtues shall be encouraged to all our citizens to make every Paraguayan a paragon of these various virtues that have brought greatness to our country."
 PAR_fixing_mess:0 "Fixing the Mess"
 PAR_fixing_mess_desc:0 "The Liberals have left us with a messy budget. While we may have won the Chaco War, government spending has made this victory short-lived as the spoils of war we gained have been quickly spent. We now have the task of balancing the budget by ourselves."
 PAR_prosperity:0 "Prosperity and Progress"
 PAR_prosperity_desc:0 "We Colorados know that the only way forward for our country is with hard work. We have to focus this spirit towards achieving economic prosperity and progress, that way we shall both be true to our ideals and help our country get back on its feet."
 PAR_correcting_social_mistakes:0 "Correcting Social Mistakes"
